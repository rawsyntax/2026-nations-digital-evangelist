## Overall Delivery Tips

### Pacing:
- Speak clearly but naturally - **don't rush**
- 120 seconds gives you plenty of time
- Brief pauses between slides (1-2 seconds) are fine
- If you finish a bit early (110-115 seconds), that's better than running over

### Emphasis Points:
- **Slide 1:** "100 members with zero incidents" (builds credibility)
- **Slide 2:** Specific business/event names (shows local knowledge)
- **Slide 3:** "Right people at the right time" (shows sophistication)
- **Slide 4:** "I've already built" (distinguishes you from other candidates)
- **Slide 5:** "Nations Dads group" (shows initiative beyond job description)

### Body Language:
- **Stand** if possible (more engaging than sitting)
- **Make eye contact** with different audience members
- **Gesture to screen** when referencing specific examples or screenshots
- **Open posture** (no crossed arms)
- **Smile** when mentioning Nations Dads group or other new ideas

### Tone:
- **Confident** but not arrogant
- **Enthusiastic** about the vision
- **Authentic** - this is YOUR community, YOUR Discord
- **Professional** but warm (neighborhood association, not boardroom)

## Backup Plans

### If slides fail to advance:
- You can deliver all key points verbally
- Main message: "100+ member Discord, 2 years experience, AI tools for social media/newsletters/Discord, Nations Dads group, vote for me"

### If you go over 120 seconds in practice:
- Cut detailed examples from Slides 2-3 (keep it to "social media" and "newsletters")
- Keep Slide 1 (credibility) and Slide 5 (CTA) full length

### If you finish early (under 110 seconds):
- Add one more specific example on Slides 2-4
- Expand on Nations Dads group vision slightly
- Pause longer between transitions
